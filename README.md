# Hello-World
My beginning of programming
HiÔºÅ I'm Aming, an engineer in a big factory.
I'm just graduated from university,and confusing about my career.
Because I don't like being an engineer in this foctory.
I can't create anything, but repeat the works,it's so boring.
So I'm trying to learn coding in order to being an software engineer.
